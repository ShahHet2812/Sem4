Twice a year, during an eclipse season that lasts about 34 days, Sun, Moon, and Earth can nearly align. Then the full and new phases of the Moon, separated by just over 14 days, create a lunar and a solar eclipse. But only rarely is the alignment at both new moon and full moon phases during a single eclipse season close enough to produce a pair with both total (or a total and an annular) lunar and solar eclipses. More often, partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season.

The time-lapse composite images were captured from Somerset, UK (left) and Rapa Nui planet Earth.

The fog itself is not confined to an arch -- the fog is mostly transparent but relatively uniform.  The fogbow shape is created by those drops with the best angle to divert sunlight to the observer.  The fogbow's relative lack of colors are caused by the relatively smaller water drops.  The drops active above are so small that the quantum mechanical wavelength of light becomes important and smears out colors that would be created by larger rainbow water drops acting like small prisms reflecting sunlight.

Distance estimates put WR 134 about 6,000 light-years away, making the frame over 50 light-years across. Shedding their outer envelopes in powerful stellar winds, massive Wolf-Rayet stars have burned through their nuclear fuel at a prodigious rate and end this final phase of massive star evolution in a spectacular supernova explosion.

In the featured image, the spherical distortion from Aldrin's helmet has been reversed.  The result is the famous picture -- but now featuring Armstrong himself from Aldrin's perspective.

But in the early 1990s, using imaging radar, the Venus orbiting Magellan spacecraft was able to lift the veil from the face of Venus and produced spectacular high resolution images of the planet's surface. Colors used in this computer generated picture of Magellan radar data are based on color images from the surface of Venus transmitted by the Soviet Venera 13 and 14 landers. The bright area running roughly across the middle represents the largest highland region of Venus known as Aphrodite Terra.\", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/venus180hem_magellan_big.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Venus Unveiled', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/venus180hem_magellan_c1.jpg'}, {'copyright': 'Stefan Seip', 'date': '2010-03-27', 'explanation': \"Stark shadows of mountains and crater walls stand out along the lunar terminator, or shadow line between night and day, in this telescopic image. Of course, if viewed from the lunar surface near the terminator line, the Sun would be rising and still close to the lunar horizon. But the picture's inset at the left highlights a more elusive lunar sunrise phenomenon. Streaming through a gap in the eastern wall of 45 kilometer wide Hesiodus crater, the low-angle sunlight produces a long sunrise ray playing along the otherwise shadowed crater floor. Sunrise rays are short-lived and can be rewarding to spot for Moon enthusiasts with telescopes. Seen in Hesiodus and other craters, the ray timing can be calculated based on the observer's location. This picture of a first quarter Moon was recorded at 23:45 UT on February 22nd from Stuttgart, Germany. In the inset, the larger crater Pitatus is at the right. For location, Hesiodus and Pitatus are circled at the bottom of the picture.\", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1003/HesiodusSunriseRay_seip.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Hesiodus Sunrise Ray', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1003/HesiodusSunriseRay_seipC900.jpg'}, {'date': '2012-12-30', 'explanation': \"Carinae may be about to explode.  But no one knows when - it may be next year, it may be one million years from now. Eta Carinae's mass - about 100 times greater than our Sun - makes it an excellent candidate for a full blown supernova. Historical records do show that about 150 years ago Eta Carinae underwent an unusual outburst that made it one of the brightest stars in the southern sky.  Eta Carinae, in the Keyhole Nebula, is the only star currently thought to emit natural LASER light. This image, taken in 1996, brought out new details in the unusual nebula that surrounds this rogue star.  Now clearly visible are two distinct lobes, a hot central region, and strange radial streaks.  The lobes are filled with lanes of gas and dust which absorb the blue and ultraviolet light emitted near the center.  The streaks remain unexplained.
